--- 1.3.0

- Add support for `call`, `apply`, and `fork` methods that use the context api.
- Add support for `join`, `cancel`, and `cancelled`, as well as hooks for when a specific `fork` returns.
- `fork` to behave more intuitively within `race` and `all` effects (the first returning task stops the race; this also works for race/all nested within other race/all, as well as yielded generators that internally yield tasks that must be awaited).
- Add mention of `putResolve` as supported.
- Fix const typescript boolean on `call` property.
- Add the `config.debug.unblock` option to log the dependency tree when simulating concurrent tasks waiting after each other. Occurs when the root SagaTester is pending (usually after a `race`, `all`, or `join`), and SagaTester must pick the fastest task to run. Will usually not happen if all tasks are ran immediately (`wait: false`)
- Add the `config.debug.bubble` option to log the dependency tree (including partial values) when a resolved pending task "bubbles up" the dependency tree, potentially causing other tasks to become unblocked.
- Add the `config.debug.interrupt` option to log interruptions of tasks, the reasons, and conditions of resuming them.
- Add the `config.options.stepLimit` option to detect infinite loops faster or slower
- Add the `config.options.yieldDecreasesTimer` option, which is set to `false` by default to avoid confusing behavior. (This is technically a breaking change if your tests relied on the decreasing step count). If set to `true`, each yield action results in the timer of active tasks to decrease by 1.
- Add the `config.options.useStaticTimes` option, `false` by default (breaking change). If `false`, whenever a task with a numbered "wait" is run, all other active tasks with a numbered "wait" is decreased by the same amount. If `true`, a numbered "wait" remains static and therefore acts more like a priority.
- Add `saga-tester/PLACEHOLDER_ARGS`.
  - Provide `PLACEHOLDER_ARGS.ANY` inside a `params` array to indicate an argument that is not important.
  - Provide `PLACEHOLDER_ARGS.TASK` inside a `params` array to indicate a task object of any content.
  - Provide `PLACEHOLDER_ARGS.TYPE(type)` inside a `params` array to indicate a value of `typeof type`.
  - Provide `PLACEHOLDER_ARGS.FN((value) => boolean)` inside a `params` array to indicate a value for which the method returns true.
- Implement awaitable calls
- Fix cancellation not bubbling down parent ownership.
- Fix cancellation not using "return" and therefore not correctly branching into "finally" statements.
- Fix race effect not cancelling losing tasks
- More flexible typescript
